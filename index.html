        <p>Victoria's Secret Perfumes | You won't find a model in the world who doesn't want to become a so-called Victoria's Secret "angel". This fashion brand was founded in 1977 by American businessman Roy Raymond. Roy concluded that most men (including himself) would appreciate the opportunity to buy underwear for their partner from a specialty store. That is why he opened such a store. The result exceeded all his expectations – already after the first year he had to open three more branches.
            <br/><br/>Today Victoria's Secret sells not only luxury clothing, but also top quality cosmetics. His perfumes are especially hugely successful. The most popular product range is probably Dream Angels, launched in 2000 and updated regularly since then.
            Victoria's Secret prides itself on employing the most famous supermodels such as Gisele Bündchen, Miranda Kerr and Naomi Campbell. She is no less selective when it comes to perfumes – Annie Buzantin, Adriana Medina, Mark Knitkowski, Alexandra Carlin, Carlos Vinais and other famous names in this field contributed to the creation of the Victoria's Secret perfume.
            <br/><br/>Other Victoria's secret products deserve a special mention – for example, shower gels and body milks or creams. They are available in many and varied collections (Lemon Escape, Vanilla Lace, Strawberry & Champagne, etc.), where everyone can find their favorite flavor. In addition, they are offered at surprisingly low prices.
            The Victoria's Secret brand will surely appeal to all women who want to be sexy, who like sensual, tender and refined perfumes and who want to try cosmetic products used by Hollywood celebrities.</p>
